# requirement-analysis in softwre development
Overview

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, documented, and analyzed. The goal is to ensure the final software product meets business and user requirements effectively.

Purpose

Understand what the users need and why they need it.

Define functional and non-functional requirements clearly.

Prevent miscommunication and costly mistakes later in the development process.

Key Steps

Requirement Gathering

Engage with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, or workshops.

Collect both functional (features, tasks) and non-functional (performance, security) requirements.

Requirement Analysis

Evaluate feasibility, consistency, and completeness of gathered requirements.

Prioritize requirements based on importance and impact.

Requirement Specification

Document requirements in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS).

Include use cases, user stories, and system workflows.

Requirement Validation

Verify requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are accurate and achievable.

Resolve ambiguities or conflicts.

Importance

Reduces development errors and rework.

Helps project managers plan resources and timelines effectively.

Ensures the final product aligns with stakeholder expectations.

Best Practices

Maintain clear and concise documentation.

Use visual models like UML diagrams, flowcharts, or prototypes.

Involve stakeholders throughout the SDLC to confirm requirements.

Continuously review and update requirements as the project evolves.
